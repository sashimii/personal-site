I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.

No argument here. Oh, I don't have time for this. __ I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.__ *Leela, are you alright?* You got wanged on the head.

## But I've never been to the moon!

It's toe-tappingly tragic! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! Bender, we're trying our best. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.

1. Oh right. I forgot about the battle.
2. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.
3. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?

### With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!

I love you, buddy! Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? I'm a thing. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.

* With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!
* She also liked to shut up!
* No! The cat shelter's on to me.

We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Say it in Russian! Bender?! You stole the atom.

Really?! Well, then good news! It's a suppository. I'll get my kit! Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.

You wouldn't. Ask anyway! I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Your best is an idiot! Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!

If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. And I'm his friend Jesus. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Tell her she looks thin. A sexy mistake.

In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Kif might! But existing is basically all I do! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!

Look, last night was a mistake. I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Your best is an idiot!

Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?

All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?

This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!

Ooh, name it after me! Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. I just told you! You've killed me! File not found. Bender, quit destroying the universe! This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.
