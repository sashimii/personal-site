Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? I never loved you. I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.

As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. __Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?__ *Why am I sticky and naked?* Did I miss something fun?

## Bender?! You stole the atom.

Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. But I've never been to the moon! OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.

1. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!
2. You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites?
3. Of all the friends I've had… you're the first.

### Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.

Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Noooooo! I wish! It's a nickel. WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!

* Why did you bring us here?
* WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!
* Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!

I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.

I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. But I've never been to the moon! We don't have a brig. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?

That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Ask her how her day was.

Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Oh, I think we should just stay friends. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.

You lived before you met me?! No argument here. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.

And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.

Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Kif might! But I've never been to the moon!

Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Kif might! I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.

Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. I just told you! You've killed me! I'll get my kit! Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!

Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Can we have Bender Burgers again?

Who are those horrible orange men? They're like sex, except I'm having them! Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!
