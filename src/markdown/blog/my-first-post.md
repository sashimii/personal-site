Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Ummm…to eBay?

You can see how I lived before I met you. __Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack!__ * I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!* Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!

## Tell them I hate them.

Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Your best is an idiot! Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!

1. No, I'm Santa Claus!
2. What kind of a father would I be if I said no?
3. Throw her in the brig.

### I wish! It's a nickel.

As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. I don't want to be rescued. And until then, I can never die? Well, then good news! It's a suppository. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

* Yes! In your face, Gandhi!
* Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!
* You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me!

We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Leela's gonna kill me. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.

What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. Why did you bring us here? Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Actually, that's still true.

Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Look, last night was a mistake. Look, last night was a mistake.

Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Tell them I hate them. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!

I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. I can explain. It's very valuable. That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!

I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!

It doesn't look so shiny to me. You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. I'm a thing. Really?!

Say it in Russian! Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.

Bite my shiny metal ass. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. And until then, I can never die? I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!

No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. Oh yeah, good luck with that. OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.

But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!
